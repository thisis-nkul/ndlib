# Numpy Deep Learning 'IBrary

This is a toy project that lets me experience what I'm learning about Neural Networks, I started this project a few days before the commencement of my freshman year.



### SO most probably this project is gonna get dropped off without CNNs being implemented but hey it'll be fun until then :P



## HOW TO INSTALL
There's no need(but ofc it is if you were requested to and are here regarding that) because TF and PyTorch are already out there showing off the best of their capabilities.
##### But still if you wanna try this(at your own risk) here's how to do it:
- If you just want to use ndlib:
    - clone/download this repo to your local PC
    - open the directory containg setup.py in terminal
    - run:
        ```bash
        python3 setup.py install
        ```
    - to uninstall, after running the following code, delete the ndlib folder(super-parent):
        ```bash
        python3 setup.py --uninstall
        ```

- If you want to play with the code as you use this library:
    - clone/download this repo to your local PC
    - open the directory containg setup.py in terminal
    - run:
        ```bash
        python3 setup.py develop
        ````
    - to uninstall, after running the following code, delete the ndlib folder(super-parent):
        ```bash
        python3 setup.py develop --uninstall
        ````

### A brief note about efficiency
I don't consider this library to be efficient because I'm pretty much new to object oriented design and software development as I write this for my initial commit but as I go on learning more(and if this project doesn't get dropped off), I'll try to optimize code. Or it might so happen that I don't optimize at all due to time crunch and just implement new features/functions for my better understanding of concepts.
